				<div id="storycontent">
						When she was 14 years old, Nicole Javorsky was hospitalized for anorexia.  During this stressful time, her family and friends brought her stuffed animals.  These cuddly creatures reminded her that people cared about her.  By 2012, Nicole was 16 and the founder of a new organization - Cubs for Coping.

			<section id="Impact">
				<div id="impactcontent">
					So far we have donated 145 handmade teddy bears to children and teens experiencing hospitalization, homelessness, or eating disorders.  Handmade items require more creativity, effort, and personalization. Each teddy bear we donate is unique, just like the people we give them to.  Personalized items help people remember that others care about them.  We remind young people facing tough times that they are not alone.
